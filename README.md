# Hands-On Digital Communication

Here you can find some hands-on projects related to **"Digital Communication"** theories.

All the abovementioned implementations are in **MATLAB**.


1- Error Probability for BPSK Modulation in AWGN Channel

2- Error Probability for BPSK Modulation with N Samples in Each Symbol

3- Effect of Pulse Shaping on the Error Probability Curve

4- Error Probability for QPSK Modulation in AWGN Channel

5- Effect of Pulse Shaping to the Error Probability Curve in Intermediate Frequency (IF)

6- Effect of Channel Coding on the Error Probability Curve
